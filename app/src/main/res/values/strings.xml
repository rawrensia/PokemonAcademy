        Requirements are specification of what should be implemented, descriptions of how a system should behave, or of a system property/attribute.
        Requirement Engineering is about identifying the purpose of a software system and the contexts in which it will be used. It refers to the activity of requirement development, which includes elicitation, specification, analysis and management of stakeholder requirements.
        Elicitation: talk to customers.
        Analysis: clarify with customers.
        Specification: write requirements in formal documents.
        Validation: check if there are conflicting requirements.

        There are two Requirement Elicitation techniques:
        Technique 1:
        1: Examine documents
        reuse existing or related documents, read standards or government regulations.
        2: Interview stakeholders
        conduct focus groups with customers to gather idea and needs.
        3: Use questionnaires or marketing surveys
        for quantitative data.

        Technique 2:
        1: Watch users do their job
        2: Prototyping: just the interface to help customers better understand the system.
        3: Task analysis: make use cases / scenarios.

        Requirement Analysis: Decompose high-level requirements into details and identify priorities.
        Requirements Specification Approaches:
        -   	Textual: vision and scope doc, use case doc, SRS
        -   	Graphical: structured analysis models (data flow diagram, entity-relationship diagram, dialog map), OO analysis models
        -   	Formal: formal specification languages.
        SRS: a set of precisely-stated properties and constraints that a software system must satisfy, and a complete description of the external behaviour of a system.
